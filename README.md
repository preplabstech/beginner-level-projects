Number_guessing_game
This is a simple beginner level code which demonstrates the usage of user defined functions, while loops, if loops and a lot more by being in the form of an interactive game.
The code is written in an elaborate format, but doubts are welcomed in the comment section, to be addressed as soon as possible.

This one might seem a bit lengthy in the beginning, but I suggest you go through it to find out that lenghty programmes are nothing but a conglomeration of small simple tasks. This code uses pytube library. you can install this library in command line and it's fairly simple to use. Feedbacks and questions are welcome. 
Happy coding!
